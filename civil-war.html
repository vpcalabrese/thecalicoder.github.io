				<p>Confederate soldier Michael F. Rinker fought in the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. A letter to his parents dated May 17, 1864, gives us a primary source glimpse into the devastating battles of the Civil War:
				<em><p>We have been so busy since we came over here, that indeed this is
				the first chance that I have had to write. The second day after we
				arrived here, we commenced fighting and it is not over yet.
				Father, indeed, for 5 days we were so busy fighting that we could
				hardly get time enough to eat our meals...There was one
				continual roar of thunder all the time from the artillery and small arms.<br><br>For six days the Battle was kept up, all the time day and night, in the dead hour of midnight, the cannon &
				musketry [rifles and guns] was thundering all the time. Column after column the Yankees pushed their men up
				to our Breastworks [defensive walls] and our men were cutting them down as fast as flies. The dead Yankees
				are heaped up in piles half as high as a man, in front of our Breastworks, and all around on the Battlefield the
				dead yanks are lying just as thick as they can be, and none of them buried, they will all rotten on top of the
				ground.<br><br>...Our men are still in line of Battle, day & night all the time; sometimes they commence [begin] fighting at
				midnight. There is no telling how much longer the fight will last. Our men lay in our Breastworks day and night.
				One night last week the yanks charged our Breastworks 9 different times, and every time our men run them
				back, with great slaughter. If I can get time I will write to you soon or as soon as I hear from you all. I will close.<br><br>Your son, Mike.</p></em>

			<strong style="font-weight: 600;">This just first shows the tremendous amount of fighting going on, the spirit that both sides have, and the two strong ideas by which the soldiers of the two sides go by constantly, unity versus secession. Michael describes battles to be a continuous roar of musketry. At the end of the day, it is Southern land and if the North loses, they have one big job of cleaning up heaps of dead bodies. It may be more significant given that land is the most important Southern value, as it produces their cash crop. You can see that in the letter's distress about the Southern fields upon which the battle was fought. They have to be fiercely determined to have slaughtered the offensive each time they are at threat. </strong>

			<p>Chickamauga cost the War <b>35,000 casualties</b>, of which more than half were Confederate soldiers. This makes it the second costliest battle of the Civil War, behind Gettysburg, and the <b>bloodiest battle of the Western Theater</b>.</b></p>
			<h3>Leading Up to the Battle</h3>
			<p>Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans planned to lead an army of 60,000 Union soldiers from a successful campaign at Tullahoma to continue the Union offensive by marching Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg and his army of 40,000 Rebels from Chattanooga, cutting them off from fleeing to Georgia and forcing them to surrender.

			<b>Capturing Chattanooga would open up the Deep South to Federal control.</b> It is obvious why the Rebels would fight fiercely in the coming battles, for the Deep South means the Union would have a grasp on the Confederacy from the inside. Bragg, knowing the disadvantage of losing Chattanooga, marches away from Chattanooga for reinforcements, making Rosecrans think the Rebels are retreating. Determined to reoccupy the city, Braggs swelled his army to 70,000 men over the course of a month and marched back toward the Union army and made a surprise counter-attack on September 18, 1863, at Chickamauga Creek. It was his army of cavalry and infantry against Federal mounted infantry, who had cutting edge Spencer repeating rifles.</p>

 			<h3>The Fight Begins</h3>
 			<p>On the morning of the 19th, the Union line held against the heavy assaults the Rebels had for them. Both sides hadn't expected the fight then and the two Generals, Rosecrans and Braggs, kept spewing more and more reinforcements as the firing from both sides continued into the afternoon. In the afternoon, Lieut. Gen. James Longstreet from Northern Virginia brought his army with eight fresh brigades to exploit a "gap" in the federal line. In fact, it was a breach at the federal line, created by Rosecrans's imagined gap in his line. Longstreet's attack caused panic and confusion among the Union troops and Rosecrans himself, making Rosecrans drive a third of his army out of the field.</p>

 			<p>Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas took over and began reinforcing forces on Horseshoe Ridge, where the Federals fought off Rebels' charges all the way until dusk. Thomas retreated with the remainder of the army from Chattanooga after nightfall and was able to save a portion of the Federal army, earning him the nickname "the Rock of Chickamauga." The surrounding heights were left to the reoccupation of the Confederates. <br>Below are the two maps showing the battlefield over the course of a full day. You can see from it that Rosecrans and Braggs setup to create a bitter and disastroe, with great effects on the outcome of the war.  </p>

 			<h3>Impact on the War</h3>
 			<p>Aside from the costliest battle in the Western Theater, the battle was considered a great Confederate victory. Chickamauga was a very strategic location and meant Georgia was safe. Well, for the time being. The outcome of the battle meant no stop for the push of the Chattanooga Campaign, which Rosecrans along with General Ulysses S. Grant had succeeded in with the later Battles of Chattanooga. </p>

 				<img src="images/civil-war/brady-photo.jpg" width="80%">
 				<figcaption><b>Mathew Brady was a prolific photographer of the Civil War. Here, his primary source photo gives us a glimpse of Sutler's Row, Chattanooga. On that street were some supply stores (we see one that sells "BOOTS, SHOES, HATS & CAPS"), a restaurant, and a few other stores. We see this is a commercial street and the visible surroundings possible foundations for more stores. The men are only white, telling of the dominance white men had over colored in the South at the time. Overall, this photo shows the development of the southern towns at the time, not quite as metropolitan as some of the northern towns.</b></figcaption>

		<h3>The Daily Observer</h3>
		<small><b><u>EDITORIAL</u></b></small>
		<p><b>Stand and Defend, Fellow Rebels!</b><br><i>Gen. Robert E. Lee, July 10, 1863</i></p>
		<blockquote style="text-indent: 3rem; margin: 0 10rem;"> 
		The defensive always has the upper hand! The defense knows the land, knows the lakes and the mountains. We have seen it with the unsuccessful Yankee attempts at grasping the heart of our Southern homeland. Now, however, we see ourselves facing the same situation the Yankee offensive faced during the last three years, as my second attempt at invading the Northern states was stopped with the force of the Union soldiers. You may have seen my last message to his Excellency about my current position at Washington. Our numbers have shrunk and I gave no solution to how we must attack, for a third time not to mention!</blockquote>
		<blockquote style="text-indent: 3rem; margin: 0 10rem;">
		I know you may be reading and thinking, "This is Lee, he served for the Union. Who's he to be challenging the President's strategy?" Of course, that is what a fake Rebel would say. You all know that I've greatly pushed the Yankees back, especially the fool, McClellan. My experience urges that we take a more strategic stance in this War, not as offenders but as defenders. You see, we are not trying to regain our Southern states back! We have seceded, and because of that, we must defend our position and status until that old bat, Lincoln, gives in to the firm stance of our farmer men. This is our home, this is our land! We must focus on defending it before it's too late!
		</blockquote>
		<h3>Graphic: We Must Stand</h3>
		<img src="images/civil-war/cartoon.jpeg" style="border: 0.1rem solid black; width: 90%;">
		<p>This original cartoon represents the costs of focusing on attacking over defending. The <b>symbolism</b> is the Confederate wall that protects the Confederacy from Union attacks. The <b>exaggeration</b> is the devastating fire that the Federals would cause to the interior of the Confederate house, such as the fire. This is also a symbol of how the strategy of splitting the Confederacy would be implemented if we do not take a stand. The <b>irony</b> here is that attacking should bring the other side down. But, it would be too costly for the South and the Union does have more supply and workforce. <b>Labeling</b> is shown with the main sides and the main idea, as well as some of the important objects in this cartoon. Overall, this <b>analogy</b> tells how the house of the Confederacy will fall if not well defended by the wall, the shield. If instead the Rebels primarily attack, the Union will achieve its main goal to destroy the Confederacy and not much damage would be done by the Rebels due to the huge costs and disadvantages of attacking.
