				<p>Confederate soldier Michael F. Rinker fought in the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. A letter to his parents dated May 17, 1864, gives us a primary source glimpse into the devastating battles of the Civil War:
				<em><p>We have been so busy since we came over here, that indeed this is
				the first chance that I have had to write. The second day after we
				arrived here, we commenced fighting and it is not over yet.
				Father, indeed, for 5 days we were so busy fighting that we could
				hardly get time enough to eat our meals...There was one
				continual roar of thunder all the time from the artillery and small arms.<br><br>For six days the Battle was kept up, all the time day and night, in the dead hour of midnight, the cannon &
				musketry [rifles and guns] was thundering all the time. Column after column the Yankees pushed their men up
				to our Breastworks [defensive walls] and our men were cutting them down as fast as flies. The dead Yankees
				are heaped up in piles half as high as a man, in front of our Breastworks, and all around on the Battlefield the
				dead yanks are lying just as thick as they can be, and none of them buried, they will all rotten on top of the
				ground.<br><br>...Our men are still in line of Battle, day & night all the time; sometimes they commence [begin] fighting at
				midnight. There is no telling how much longer the fight will last. Our men lay in our Breastworks day and night.
				One night last week the yanks charged our Breastworks 9 different times, and every time our men run them
				back, with great slaughter. If I can get time I will write to you soon or as soon as I hear from you all. I will close.<br><br>Your son, Mike.</p></em>

			<strong style="font-weight: 900;">This just first shows the tremendous amount of fighting going on, the spirit that both sides have, and the two strong ideas by which the soldiers of the two sides go by constantly, unity versus secession. Michael describes battles to be a continuous roar of musketry. At the end of the day, it is Southern land and if the North loses, they have one big job of cleaning up heaps of dead bodies. It may be more significant given that land is the most important Southern value, as it produces their cash crop. They have to be fiercely determined to have slaughtered the offensive each time they are at threat. </strong>
